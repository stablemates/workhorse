-- workhorse-migration: {"kind":"additive"}

-- Row retention lag waits for history retention (SM-887).

-- workhorse.prune_terminal_tasks_v1 deletes a terminal task only after daily history retention has
-- passed the task's history_through_at. Queue health measured task-identity and terminal-outcome
-- lag from the row retention windows alone, so a row that only that gate held counted as lag.
-- History retention advances in whole days at its local time, so in steady state the measured lag
-- climbed past the default row budget for most of every day, and no per-pass limit could clear it.

-- The eligible boundaries now apply the same history gate as the prune. A history retention pass
-- that stops advancing remains visible through the task event and attempt history retention lag.
